#### Instructions#############################

	1. Download Eclipse (I used Eclipse Juno)
	2. create java project with name DependenciesProject
	3. Copy java package and java file into project
	4. Create input folder inside project and copy input file
	5. Create output folder inside project 

#### the output file "output.txt" which is located under folder output ###################
Limitation: I have extracted hierarychy but I couldn't display third child in the required hierarychy but I will try hard to manage it





Idea:
1. First I read order and depedency and store both file into arraylist
2. Then, I created intermediate order-depedency arraylist which contains informations of id, name and parentid using order and depedency file
3. Then, I use recursive function
